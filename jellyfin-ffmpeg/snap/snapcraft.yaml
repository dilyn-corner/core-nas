summary: ffmpeg binaries and libraries from the Jellyfin project
description: |
  This snap provides the ffmpeg binaries and libraries used by the Jellyfin
  project to facilitate things like hardware encode/decode.

  It serves a similar purpose to other snaps such as mesa-2404 and
  ffmpeg-2204, but with an alternative upstream.

  It follows a similar practices as the mesa-2404 snap. Snaps which consume
  this snap should try and make use of the suggestions in the gpu-snap repository:
