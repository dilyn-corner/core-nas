# Core NAS

A centralized location to find the source files for a variety of snaps which
are intended by used on Ubuntu Core devices, specifically with the intention of
being used as a NAS.

## Details

Please refer to each folder for their respective's snaps details.

This repository may be expanded or contracted over time.

Currently looking for someone to work on a flutter app with to provide a loose
setup-UI :)

## Branches

It's expected that a branch will exist for each major Core release where work
specific for those releases will be kept. The main branch will hold all the
latest work and may be potentially unstable.

Some snaps may not function on newer base snaps and will be kept back until resolved.
